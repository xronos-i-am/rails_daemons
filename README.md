# RailsDaemons

Daemons for Rails. Can be controlled by [https://github.com/erikhuda/thor|Thor] on the host or remotely by [https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano|Capistrano]. Can be monitored and automatically restarted by [https://mmonit.com/monit/|Monit]. When daemon restarts the new worker hasn't started till the old one is shutdowned. Workers can be gracefully stopped on ```Ctrl + C```.

The gem based on [|]

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rails_daemons'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails_daemons

## Usage

Create daemon worker. It should have two methods: 
  
  * ```tick``` - delay between daemon cycles (in seconds)
  * ```work``` - main work that should be done by daemon

Also you can specify:

  * ```start``` - work that should be done on the daemon`s start
  * ```shutdown``` - work that should be done before the daemon`s stop (ie, store raised error to database)

Example usage (with Mongoid):

  ```ruby
    class Parsing
      include Mongoid::Document

      field :url
      field :state, default: 'pending'

      scope :pending, ->() { where( state: 'pending' ) }
      scope :running, ->() { where( state: 'running' ) }

      class << self
        def start
          [ 'http://www.example.com' ].each do |url|
            create!( url: url )
          end
        end
      end

      def process( logger ) 
        set( state: 'running' )

        # do the job

      rescue Exception => e
        logger.info e.inspect
        
        set( state: 'halted' )
      end
    end

    class ParserWorker < RailsDaemons::Worker
      def tick
        3 # in seconds
      end

      # daemon start
      def start
        require 'mechanize'
        require 'rufus-scheduler'

        scheduler = Rufus::Scheduler.new

        scheduler.every '12h' do
          Parsing.start # create parsing jobs every 12 hours
        end
      end

      # main work
      def work
        Parsing.pending.each do |parsing|
          t = Thread.new do
            parsing.process( $logger )
          end

          # exceptions handled in method ```process``` (just for an example)
          t.abort_on_exception = false
        end
      end

      # stop the daemon
      def shutdown
        Parsing.running.each do |parsing|
          parsing.set( state: 'stopped' )
        end
      end
    end  

  ```
